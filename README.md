## Startup Accelerator
The startup accelerator is a program run by MongoDB Growth Marketing and Developer Relations that focuses on helping Founders and Developers at Startup Companies focus on building their business rather than managing their databases.

The MongoDB Startup Accelerator offers access to MongoDB Atlas, the fully-managed global cloud database, and support to help startups like [Radar](https://resources.mongodb.com/vimeo-all-videos/mongodb-atlas-customer-story-radar), [Lorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DTO3_7mOeU) and [BubbleIQ](https://resources.mongodb.com/vimeo-all-videos/bubbleiq-moves-fast-with-mongodb) build and scale their businesses.
